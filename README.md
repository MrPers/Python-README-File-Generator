# Professional README.md Generator

Yo, developer.
I got that premium Python CLI package - clean, fast, no bugs cut into the product.
One run and you’re walking away with a slick, professional README.md that makes your Git repo look like top-shelf merchandise.
Interactive prompts smooth as a back-alley deal (powered by InquirerPy), and terminal output so fresh it shines (thanks to Rich).
No filler, no nonsense - just pure presentation power.

## Features

- **Interactive CLI:** Guided prompts for project title, description, and instructions.
- **Smart License Selection:** Dropdown menu featuring common licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.).
- **Professional Formatting:** Generates valid Markdown with automated badges and clean structures.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Uses `Rich` to provide colored success messages and error handling.
